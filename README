## Security Summary/Design Guideline

### Nothing can occur without a token (except for during the install process

This simplified the security of the app down to the internal permissions and the token generation and validation process. Limiting the attack surface.

### The highest level of security (and an equal level) must be applied to the breakglass account and database user and root user

The root user is used briefly and deleted for the app to never remember it.

All 3 accounts provide the same level access (to access all information). And their security profile must be the same.

e.g. you can not change the breakglass account password without logging in with it first, or manually updating the table entry with the database user. No other user can.
