## Security Summary/Design Guideline

### Nothing can occur without a token (except for during the install process)

This simplifies the security of the app down to the internal permissions and the token generation and validation process. Limiting the attack surface to the tokens. An attacker must obtain a valid token to do anything. This puts the dependency more then on token checking/validation, how long they last and the login process. More on the login process below.

### The highest level of security (and an equal level) must be applied to the breakglass account, app database user and root database user

The root user is used briefly and deleted for the app to never remember it.

All 3 accounts provide the same level access (to access all information). And their security profile must be the same.

e.g. you can not change the breakglass account password without logging in with it first, or manually updating the table entry with the database user. No other user can.

### Difficult logon process

The logon process must be computationally difficult but fast enough (and eventually use MFA).

### No expense spared on passwords (complex password policies are unnecessary and annoying, long passwords are simple until MFA is set up). Where's that entropy calculator

They must be long, breakglass must be at least 30 characters.
